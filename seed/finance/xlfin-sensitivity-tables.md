# Sensitivity Tables (One- and Two-Variable)

## When to use
Use when a strategy or finance model has a single key output and you want to show how that output responds as one or two drivers vary across a range. Typical drivers are price, volume, discount rate, growth, churn, or cost per unit. This skill BUILDS a downloadable .xlsx from scratch in the Claude app (openpyxl plus numpy), with live formulas and a recalc-and-verify pass. It is not the Claude for Excel add-in.

## What it builds
A single `Sensitivity` tab that attaches to an existing model. It references the model's input cells and output cell, lays out one-variable and two-variable grids, and color-scales the result block. If the source model lives on another sheet, the grid links to it with cross-sheet references so it stays live.

## Build workflow
1. Identify the output cell (for example `Model!B40` holding NPV) and the one or two input cells that drive it (for example `Model!B6` discount rate, `Model!B7` growth).
2. Confirm the output is a live formula chain back to those inputs. If the output is hardcoded, stop and wire the model first; a Data Table over a constant returns the constant.
3. Choose input ranges around the base case (for example base discount rate 10 percent, sweep 6 to 14 percent in steps of 2).
4. Build the native Excel Data Table structure: corner formula, input axes, and the `{=TABLE(r,c)}` array (see spec).
5. ALSO build the code-computed grid as a robust fallback: re-evaluate the model in Python across every input combination and write the resulting values as a labeled matrix.
6. Apply a 3-color scale to the result block and label both axes with the input cell names.
7. Add the Checks block.
8. Recalculate the workbook in a real engine (headless LibreOffice).
9. Verify zero formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #NAME?), confirm the checks pass, then deliver the .xlsx.

## Tab-by-tab spec

### Sensitivity tab, one-variable block
Pick a layout direction. For inputs running DOWN a column:
- `B3`: the output formula, referencing the live output: `=Model!B40`. This is the corner cell.
- `A4:A10`: the input values you sweep (blue inputs), for example 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, 14%.
- `B4:B10`: the Data Table results column.
- Select `A3:B10`, then Data > What-If Analysis > Data Table, leaving Row input cell blank and setting Column input cell to `Model!B6`. Excel writes `{=TABLE(,Model!B6)}` into `B4:B10`.
- openpyxl can write the array formula string `=TABLE(,Model!B6)` into the block and the `=Model!B40` corner, but the values only populate after recalculation in a real engine.

Code-computed fallback for the same block (recommended when generating via code), written to a labeled matrix below, say starting `A14`:
- `A14`: label "Discount rate". `B14`: "NPV (computed)".
- For each input value in `A15:A21`, Python sets `Model!B6` to that value, recomputes the model logic in numpy, and writes the resulting NPV as a plain value in column B.
- Keep both: the native Data Table proves it is live; the computed matrix guarantees populated numbers even before the user opens Excel.

### Sensitivity tab, two-variable block
- Corner cell `E3`: `=Model!B40` (the live output).
- `E4:E10`: row-input values DOWN the left edge (first driver, for example growth 0%, 1%, ... 6%).
- `F3:L3`: column-input values ACROSS the top row (second driver, for example discount rate 6% ... 14%).
- Select `E3:L10`, Data > What-If Analysis > Data Table, Row input cell = `Model!B7` (the across driver), Column input cell = `Model!B6` (the down driver). Excel fills `F4:L10` with `{=TABLE(Model!B7,Model!B6)}`.
- Watch the orientation: the cell tied to the TOP row goes in Row input cell; the cell tied to the LEFT column goes in Column input cell. Swapping them transposes the result silently.
- Code-computed fallback: a double loop in Python over both axes, writing the value matrix to a labeled block (axis headers in green if they pull from the model, blue if literal sweep values).

### Choosing axis ranges
- Center each axis on the base-case value so the base sits in the middle row and middle column, which makes the center-cell check meaningful.
- Use an odd number of steps (5, 7, or 9) so a single middle cell lines up exactly with the base case rather than falling between two cells.
- Keep step sizes uniform on each axis (constant increment) so the grid reads as a clean gradient and the color scale is interpretable.
- For rates, sweep in absolute points (8%, 10%, 12%), not relative percent of the base, to avoid confusing readers.

### openpyxl build notes
- Write the corner as a real formula string: `ws["B3"] = "=Model!B40"`. Do not paste the current numeric value of the output.
- For the native Data Table array, openpyxl can store the `=TABLE(...)` text, but a real engine must recalculate to fill the block; treat the array as a placeholder until the recalc step runs.
- When writing the computed fallback, set the data values with Python (`ws.cell(row=r, column=c, value=float(npv))`) and keep them visually distinct from the live block with a header note such as "computed snapshot".
- Apply the color scale with `openpyxl.formatting.rule.ColorScaleRule` over the result block, mapping min to one color and max to another through a midpoint.

## Formula and formatting conventions
- Blue font for inputs (the swept axis values you type in).
- Black font for in-tab formulas.
- Green font for cross-tab links such as `=Model!B40`.
- No hardcodes where a formula belongs: the corner cell must be `=Model!B40`, never the typed base-case number.
- One consistent formula per row or column: the entire Data Table block is a single array; the computed fallback uses one Python expression applied across the grid.
- Number formats: rates as `0.0%`, currency outputs as `#,##0`, ratios as `0.00`. Axis values match the unit of the input cell they replace.

## Checks
- Corner cell equals the live output: `=(B3=Model!B40)` returns TRUE.
- Axes labeled with the input cell names (a text label above or beside each axis naming the driver and its cell address).
- Center of the grid matches the base case: the grid cell at the base-case row and base-case column equals the model's current output, `=(<center cell>=Model!B40)` TRUE.
- For the computed fallback, the cell at the base inputs equals the native Data Table cell at the same inputs (within rounding).

## Recalculate and verify
Save with openpyxl, then recalc headless (for example `libreoffice --headless --convert-to xlsx`) so `=TABLE(...)` and cross-sheet links populate. Reload and scan every cell for #REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #NAME?. Confirm the three checks return TRUE. If any error or FALSE appears, fix the reference or range and loop until clean, then deliver.

## Inputs to gather
- Path to the source model and the exact output cell address.
- The one or two input cell addresses to sweep.
- Base-case values and the desired range and step for each axis.
- Units and preferred number formats for axes and output.

## Example
Hypothetical model: `Model!B40` = project NPV, driven by `Model!B6` discount rate (base 10%) and `Model!B7` revenue growth (base 3%). One-variable block sweeps discount rate 6% to 14% by 2%, giving NPV of (for example) 1,210 / 980 / 760 / 560 / 380 in hypothetical units. Two-variable block crosses growth 0% to 6% against discount rate 6% to 14%; the center cell at 3% growth and 10% discount equals `Model!B40` of 760, confirming the base case sits in the middle of the grid.
