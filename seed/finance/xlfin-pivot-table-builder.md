# Pivot Table Builder

## When to use
Use this when you have a flat data range, one row per record, and need a summarized view by
category, time period, or segment, and would rather describe the summary you want than
build the pivot table manually.

## Instructions
1. Confirm the data range is genuinely flat: one header row, no merged cells, no subtotal rows mixed into the data.
2. Ask what question the summary needs to answer if it is not stated, since that decides which fields go where.
3. Propose the pivot table layout: which field goes to Rows, which to Columns, which to Values (and the aggregation, sum, count, or average), and any Filters.
4. Build the pivot table with that layout.
5. Flag any field that will not aggregate cleanly, for example a text column dropped into Values by mistake.

## Example prompts
- "Use the pivot-table-builder skill to summarize this sales data by region and month."
- "Build a pivot showing headcount by department and level from this raw HR export."

## Output
A pivot table specification (rows, columns, values, filters) and the built pivot table on the worksheet, with a one-line note on what it answers.
