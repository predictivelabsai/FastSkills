## When to Use

- A user has a draft witness statement for England and Wales civil proceedings.
- The statement needs checking against documents, chronology, pleadings, or disclosure.
- The user wants issues flagged before signing, service, exchange, or filing.
- The draft may contain argument, speculation, hearsay, unsupported recollection, or inconsistent dates.

This skill is a review workflow. It does not certify truth, settle admissibility, or replace solicitor/counsel sign-off.

## Audience and Work Shape

Audience: England and Wales litigation lawyers, pupils/trainees, and paralegals reviewing witness evidence under supervision before service or filing.

Work shape: pattern-matched review with accretive judgment. The skill classifies paragraph types, flags support/rule issues, and prepares questions for the responsible lawyer/witness; it does not certify the evidence.

## Legal Failure Modes

- Legal support, not legal advice: the review flags drafting, evidential, and procedural issues; it does not certify truth, admissibility, or compliance.
- Privilege/confidentiality: witness drafts, exhibits, and reviewer comments may be privileged or confidential. Use approved environments and keep outputs within the privilege group unless a responsible lawyer approves circulation.
- Accountability: the witness owns the truth of the evidence, and the responsible lawyer owns service, filing, and strategic use.

## Access Modes

This skill works in three modes:

1. **Live source mode** - use browser, web search, MCP, API, or other configured access to retrieve public rules, orders, filings, or source documents.
2. **User-supplied source mode** - use the draft statement plus uploaded or pasted exhibits, pleadings, correspondence, chronology, disclosure, prior statements, rules, or orders supplied by the user.
3. **No-source mode** - review the statement's internal drafting issues and produce a source-request checklist, but do not mark factual assertions as supported.

If exhibits, documents, rules, or orders cannot be retrieved or supplied, mark the relevant check `source_missing` or `verify_current_rule`. Do not verify facts or procedural compliance from model memory.

## How It Works

### 1. Confirm context

Identify:

- Court or tribunal, claim type, and procedural stage.
- Witness role: party, employee, expert-adjacent fact witness, third party, or litigant in person.
- Purpose: interim application, trial, summary judgment, costs, or pre-action evidence.
- Governing directions, page limits, exhibit rules, or court-specific order.
- Source set: pleadings, chronology, exhibits, correspondence, disclosure, and prior statements.

If the governing order or forum is unknown, flag CPR/PD points as `verify_current_rule`.

If the forum is a tribunal or specialist court not governed by the CPR witness statement regime, identify the applicable procedural rules and mark CPR/PD checks as `not_applicable_or_verify`.

### 2. Build a statement map

For each paragraph, classify:

- `first-hand fact`
- `hearsay or reported fact`
- `belief or inference`
- `argument or submission`
- `legal conclusion`
- `procedural background`
- `exhibit reference`
- `needs_source`

Keep paragraph numbers stable. The output should let a drafter jump straight to the problem paragraph.

### 3. Check source support

For each factual assertion:

- Tie it to a source document, exhibit, correspondence item, chronology entry, or witness knowledge basis.
- Quote or pinpoint the supporting material.
- Mark unsupported assertions as `needs_source`.
- Mark document conflicts as `source_conflict`.
- Preserve uncertainty: a witness can say what they recall, but the review must show where documents differ.

### 4. Check drafting and compliance risks

Flag:

- Argument dressed as evidence.
- Legal submissions or conclusions better left to skeleton argument.
- Speculation about another person's state of mind.
- Hearsay that needs a clear source or notice analysis.
- Collective phrases such as "we knew" without identifying who knew what.
- Dates, amounts, names, and defined terms inconsistent with documents or pleadings.
- Missing or vague exhibit references.
- Overlong narrative, irrelevant background, or duplicated chronology.
- PD 57AC trial witness statement requirements, certificate of compliance, and confirmation of compliance where applicable; otherwise mark `not_applicable_or_verify`.
- Statement of truth, signature, date, interpreter, translation, or exhibit formatting issues where applicable.

Do not invent procedural requirements from memory. If current CPR/PD wording matters, retrieve it or mark `verify_current_rule`.

## Confidence Bands

- High: issue is directly supported by the statement text and supplied exhibit/source.
- Medium: issue is visible on the draft but depends on current rule, order, or witness confirmation.
- Low: source is missing, forum/rule status is unclear, or the point turns on admissibility/weight.

## Escalation

Stop and route to the responsible lawyer when evidence is hearsay-critical, a source conflict affects a material fact, PD 57AC or a court order is unclear, the statement contains argument or legal conclusions that drive the case, or the user asks whether the statement is ready to sign/file.

### 5. Produce a review report

Recommended output:

| Paragraph | Issue | Severity | Source / Pinpoint | Rule / Source Checked | Suggested Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Severity values:

- `critical` - likely service/signing/accuracy problem.
- `major` - material evidential or drafting risk.
- `minor` - clarity, formatting, or housekeeping issue.
- `verify` - rule or source needs checking.

Then include:

- Key inconsistencies with documents.
- Unsupported factual assertions.
- Argument/legal-conclusion paragraphs.
- Exhibit and statement-of-truth checklist.
- Questions for the witness or solicitor.

## Example

```text
Review this draft witness statement against the documents and chronology. Flag unsupported paragraphs, argument, hearsay, date conflicts, and CPR/PD compliance issues. Do not rewrite the statement unless I ask.
```

For paragraph classifications and witness-evidence review axes, see `references/witness-review-playbook.md`.

## Limitations

- The witness, not the agent, owns the truth of the evidence.
- Current CPR, Practice Direction, court order, and tribunal rules must be checked where compliance matters.
- Privileged comments and drafts require an approved processing environment.
- This skill flags evidential risk; it does not make final admissibility rulings.
