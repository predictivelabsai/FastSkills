# CCP Classification

Structured workflow for classifying how Competition Compliance Programmes (CCPs) are treated in competition enforcement documents (policy documents and cases/judgments).

## Workflow Overview

1. **Convert** — PDF → Markdown using PyMuPDF
2. **Translate** — If not English, translate to English
3. **Analyse** — Read entire document, identify all CCP-relevant paragraphs
4. **Classify** — Assign category based on full understanding
5. **Scratchpad** — Save working notes and classification to file
6. **Excel** — Ask permission, then populate Output.xlsx

---

## Phase 1: Convert PDF to Markdown

When the user provides a PDF file path:

1. Run the following Python snippet via Bash to extract text:
   ```python
   import fitz, sys
   doc = fitz.open(sys.argv[1])
   md = "\n\n".join(page.get_text("text") for page in doc)
   with open("_tmp_converted.md", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
       f.write(md)
   print("Converted successfully.")
   ```
   Example: `python3 -c "..." path/to/document.pdf`

2. Read `_tmp_converted.md` to confirm content loaded correctly.

3. Inform user: "PDF converted. Beginning analysis..."

---

## Phase 2: Language Check & Translation

1. Read `_tmp_converted.md`.
2. Determine the language of the document.
3. **If NOT English**: translate the entire content into fluent English, preserving all structure and formatting. Overwrite `_tmp_converted.md` with the translated content.
4. **If English**: proceed directly.

---

## Phase 3: Full Document Analysis

Read the **entire** converted markdown. Do not skim — classification must be based on a full understanding of the document.

**3a. Extract document metadata** (needed for Excel if a new row must be created):
- **Name of Document** (Col A): PDF basename without extension (e.g., `Case_EU_1`)
- **Country / Authority** (Col B): the jurisdiction or authority the document relates to (e.g., `EU`, `UK`, `France`, `Canada Competition Bureau`)
- **Document Type** (Col C): one of `Policy Document`, `Case`, `Judgment`, `Decision`, `Guidelines`, or similar
- **Title** (Col D): the official title of the document as found in its header/cover
- **Date** (Col E): the date of publication, decision, or last modification as stated in the document; if not found, use the PDF file's modification date

**3b. Identify CCP-relevant content**: Identify all paragraphs that mention any of the following (and variations):
- compliance programme / compliance program
- compliance system / compliance framework
- compliance measures / compliance culture
- internal compliance / corporate compliance

**Critical rule for cases and judgments**: The document may contain arguments made by the parties (company, authority, opposing counsel). These arguments do NOT determine the classification. Only the **court's or authority's own decision, ruling, or finding** is what counts.

Consult `assets/examples.md` for calibration on edge cases. Note whether CCP treatment is explicit or only implied.

---

## Phase 4: Classify

Assign one of the following categories based on the authority's/court's treatment.

### Confidence Bands (required)

Every classification MUST be tagged with one of the following confidence bands. Record the band in the scratchpad and surface it in the Phase 6 summary so a downstream researcher can triage which rows need re-review without re-reading each document.

| Band | When to apply |
|------|---------------|
| **High** | Explicit ruling/decision language from the authority or court directly stating how the CCP is treated; multiple corroborating passages; no translation step or translation is from a closely related language with stable terminology. |
| **Medium** | Authority/court treatment is clear from context but not stated in a single explicit sentence; reasoning required to bridge passages; or High-quality classification that depends on a translation from a non-English source. |
| **Low** | Single ambiguous paragraph; treatment inferred from indirect language; translation fidelity uncertain; mixed signals across passages. Low confidence rows are candidates for `unsure` and must be re-reviewed before any downstream use. |

If you cannot honestly justify at least **Medium**, prefer the `unsure` category over forcing a primary label.

### Category Table



| Category | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| `as an offence` | CCP existence treated as aggravating factor — CCP deemed a façade, ineffective, or its violation increases penalty |
| `as a defence (allowed)` | CCP raised as mitigating factor AND the authority/court accepted it, reducing the fine/penalty — **cases/judgments only** |
| `as a defence (rejected)` | CCP raised as mitigating factor BUT the authority/court rejected it — **cases/judgments only** |
| `as a defence` | CCP treated as a mitigating factor; outcome not further distinguished — **policy documents only** |
| `as a remedy` | CCP imposed or mandated as a corrective/remedial measure (e.g., condition of settlement) |
| `as offence and remedy` | Both offence and remedy roles present in the same document |
| `as defence and remedy` | Both defence and remedy roles present in the same document |
| `irrelevant` | CCP mentioned but not treated under any enforcement role (e.g., merely referenced in passing) |
| `unsure` | CCP referenced but how it was treated is genuinely ambiguous — state reason clearly |
| `neutral` | Authority acknowledges CCP existence but neither accepts nor rejects it as relevant to the outcome |

**Document type rule:**
- **Case or judgment** → use `as a defence (allowed)` or `as a defence (rejected)` sub-categories
- **Policy document** by a competition authority → use plain `as a defence`

If uncertain: do not guess. Use `unsure` and explain why.

## Phase 5: Create Scratchpad

1. Derive the scratchpad filename from the input PDF basename:
   - Input: `Case_EU_1.pdf` → Output: `scratchpad_Case_EU_1.md`
2. Copy the structure from `assets/ScratchpadTemplate.md`.
3. Fill in:
   - **Category**: the assigned category
   - **Explanation/Note**: one precise, concise sentence explaining the classification. If anything is unclear, weird, or not mentioned, state that explicitly.
   - **Reference**: the full verbatim paragraph(s) from the source document on which the classification is based
   - **Uncertainty Flags**: check any that apply
   - **Relevant CCP Paragraphs**: list all CCP-mentioning paragraphs with brief annotations
4. Save to the current working directory.
5. Clean up: delete `_tmp_converted.md`.

---

## Phase 6: Ask Permission Before Excel Update

Report to the user:
```
Scratchpad saved: scratchpad_[name].md

Classification summary:
- Category: [category]
- Explanation: [one sentence]
- Reference: "[excerpt...]"

Proceed to update Output.xlsx? (yes/no)
```

Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Phase 7: Update Output.xlsx

1. Locate `Output.xlsx` in the current working directory.
2. Search **all sheets** (AgencyDoc, UK, Canada, USA, EU, France, Sweden, Italy, Spain) for a row where **Column A** matches the input PDF basename (without extension, case-insensitive).

**If a matching row is found:**
- Fill in only:
  - **Column F** (`Category`)
  - **Column G** (`Explanation/Note`)
  - **Column H** (`Reference`)
- Save and report: "Updated existing row for [document name] in sheet [sheet name]."

**If no matching row is found:**
- Determine the correct sheet:
  - Document type is **Policy Document / Guidelines / Agency publication** → `AgencyDoc` sheet
  - Document type is **Case / Judgment / Decision** → the sheet matching the country (e.g., `UK`, `EU`, `France`, `Canada`, `USA`, `Sweden`, `Italy`, `Spain`)
  - **Halt on novel jurisdiction**: if the country/authority does NOT match any of the nine listed sheets, **STOP**. Do NOT silently fall back to `AgencyDoc`. Report to the user:
    > "Novel jurisdiction detected: [country/authority]. The configured sheets are: AgencyDoc, UK, Canada, USA, EU, France, Sweden, Italy, Spain. Output.xlsx will NOT be modified until you confirm one of the following: (a) route to AgencyDoc with a novel-jurisdiction flag in Column G; (b) add a new sheet for this jurisdiction and re-run; (c) abort this classification."
    Wait for explicit user direction. Under no circumstances append the row before the user has chosen.
- Append a new row at the bottom of the correct sheet, filling in **all columns**:
  - **Column A** (`Name of Document`): PDF basename without extension
  - **Column B** (`Country / Authority`): extracted in Phase 3a
  - **Column C** (`Document Type`): extracted in Phase 3a
  - **Column D** (`Title`): extracted in Phase 3a
  - **Column E** (`Date`): extracted in Phase 3a
  - **Column F** (`Category`): the assigned category
  - **Column G** (`Explanation/Note`): the one-sentence explanation
  - **Column H** (`Reference`): the verbatim reference paragraph(s)
- Save and report: "No existing row found — created new row for [document name] in sheet [sheet name]."

Use openpyxl via Bash to perform the read and write. When appending, use `ws.append([...])` to add the new row after the last populated row.

## QA Remediation (LegalQuants, 2026-05)

This skill was imported from Leona Zhang's MIT-licensed GitHub release and evaluated against the Legal Skill Design Framework on 2026-05-11. The original technical content (PDF→Markdown conversion, taxonomy, scratchpad workflow, Excel update logic) is preserved unchanged. The following targeted additions were made under a "SOME CONCERN" verdict:

1. **Confidence Bands (High / Medium / Low)** added to Phase 4. Every classification must now carry a confidence band so that downstream researchers can triage rows for re-review. Low-confidence outputs should default to `unsure` rather than being forced into a primary label. This addresses the QA finding that the original `unsure`/`neutral` labels did not operationalise certainty against the *primary* classification.
2. **Halt-on-novel-jurisdiction** behaviour added to Phase 7. The previous instruction silently fell back to the `AgencyDoc` sheet whenever a country/authority did not match one of the nine configured sheets. That silent fall-through could quietly corrupt `Output.xlsx` by routing (for example) a Japanese or Australian decision into the agency-document bucket. The remediated behaviour halts before any write, surfaces the novel jurisdiction explicitly, and requires the user to choose between flagged routing, adding a new sheet, or aborting.
3. **Frontmatter versioning**: `version: 1.0.0`, `last_reviewed: 2026-05`, and `last_reviewed_by: LegalQuants (QA remediation)` added alongside the original `author:` and license attribution. Leona's authorship and the MIT LICENSE are preserved as required.

Remaining QA observations not addressed in this pass (audience block, scope-boundary section, "limits / not legal advice" block, moving inline Python into `scripts/`, surfacing the PDF-date fallback in the scratchpad, halt-on-translation-confidence trigger) are flagged in `/tmp/qa-results/classify-ccp.md` for a future review cycle.
