## When to Use

- A user has a draft disclosure list, disclosure review export, or document schedule.
- The team needs to check whether obvious sources, custodians, adverse documents, or inspection objections are missing.
- Privilege, confidentiality, redaction, or inspection wording needs first-pass review.
- The matter is in England and Wales civil litigation.

This skill is a quality-control workflow. It does not make final privilege calls or certify disclosure compliance.

## Audience and Work Shape

Audience: England and Wales litigation associates, paralegals, and disclosure-support teams preparing a disclosure list or QC report for solicitor/partner review.

Work shape: pattern-matched review with accretive judgment elements. The skill maps coverage and flags privilege/adverse-document issues; it does not certify disclosure compliance.

## Legal Failure Modes

- Legal support, not legal advice: the report is a QC aid, not a certification of compliance or privilege.
- Privilege/confidentiality: disclosure review may itself be privileged work product. Keep outputs inside the privilege group unless a responsible lawyer approves circulation.
- Accountability: the responsible solicitor decides privilege, inspection, adverse-document significance, and whether the list is adequate.

## Access Modes

This skill works in three modes:

1. **Live source mode** - use browser, web search, MCP, API, or other configured access to retrieve rules, orders, filings, document lists, or repository exports.
2. **User-supplied source mode** - use uploaded or pasted disclosure lists, pleadings, chronologies, witness statements, search records, document schedules, rules, or orders supplied by the user.
3. **No-source mode** - prepare a disclosure QC checklist and source-request list, but do not state that coverage, privilege, inspection, or adverse-document issues exist.

If the disclosure list, source documents, search record, or governing order cannot be retrieved or supplied, mark the relevant issue `source_missing` or `verify_current_rule`. Do not infer disclosure defects from model memory.

## How It Works

### 1. Confirm disclosure context

Identify:

- Court, track, procedural stage, and applicable disclosure regime or order.
- Issues for disclosure or pleaded issues.
- Custodians, repositories, date ranges, and search terms used.
- Whether the list is standard disclosure, issue-based disclosure, specific disclosure, pre-action disclosure, or another ordered exercise.
- Whether privileged material is listed, withheld, redacted, or omitted under the relevant approach.

If the governing order or rule is unavailable, mark rule conclusions `verify_current_rule`.

### 2. Inventory the list

For each entry or category, capture:

- Document id or range.
- Date.
- Document type.
- Author, sender, recipient, or custodian where available.
- Description.
- Issue tag.
- Inspection status.
- Privilege or confidentiality claim.
- Redaction status.

Preserve original identifiers. Do not renumber in a way that breaks the user's list.

For every gap, concern, or label, cite the source that supports it: list row/document id, pleading paragraph, witness statement reference, chronology entry, correspondence thread, search record, or order term. If the source is not available, mark `source_missing`.

### 3. Check coverage

Compare the list against:

- Pleaded issues.
- Chronology.
- Key correspondence threads.
- Known custodians and repositories.
- Expected document classes, such as contracts, notices, board minutes, invoices, complaints, expert material, or meeting notes.

Flag:

- Missing time periods.
- Missing custodians.
- Missing repositories.
- One-sided productions where adverse documents would be expected.
- Documents referenced in pleadings or witness statements but absent from the list.
- Duplicates, superseded drafts, or unclear families.

### 4. Check inspection and privilege flags

For withheld, redacted, or non-inspectable documents, flag:

- No basis stated.
- Privilege description too vague.
- Business document labelled privileged because a lawyer is copied.
- Attachment treated the same as covering email without separate review.
- Confidentiality used where a confidentiality ring or redaction may be the issue.
- Redactions with no reason or scope.

Keep close privilege calls as `needs_lawyer_review`. Under-calling privilege can waive rights; over-flagging can be corrected.

### 5. Identify adverse and helpful documents

Mark documents as:

- `potentially_adverse`
- `potentially_supportive`
- `neutral`
- `unclear`

This is a triage label, not a legal conclusion. Cite the description, issue tag, or source text that caused the label.

### 6. Produce the QC report

Recommended sections:

1. Coverage summary.
2. Missing sources and custodians.
3. Documents referenced elsewhere but absent.
4. Inspection, privilege, and redaction issues.
5. Potentially adverse document flags.
6. Rule/order points needing verification.
7. Questions for the responsible lawyer or legal reviewer.

## Confidence Bands

- High: issue is directly supported by a list row, order term, pleading paragraph, or supplied document.
- Medium: issue is inferred from a pleaded issue, chronology entry, or witness reference and needs source confirmation.
- Low: source is missing, search record absent, privilege basis unclear, or inspection requires document-level review.

## Escalation

Stop and route to the responsible solicitor when the disclosure order conflicts with the list, foreign-law privilege is implicated, a custodian is also a key witness, an inspection challenge is imminent, privilege basis is uncertain on material documents, or the source/search record is too incomplete to assess coverage.

## Example

```text
Review this draft disclosure list against the pleadings and chronology. Flag missing custodians, documents referenced elsewhere but absent, weak privilege descriptions, inspection objections, and potentially adverse documents.
```

## Limitations

- Current CPR, Practice Direction, disclosure pilot/order terms, and court directions must be verified.
- The skill cannot know what searches were actually run unless the user provides that record.
- Privilege decisions require lawyer review.
- Adverse-document labels are investigative leads, not admissions.
