# Legal Translation Skill  `v0.2.0`

**Legal translation that thinks about legal effect, not literal words.**

This skill is the international extension of **Modern Jurist** — a legal translation
app originally built for the Indian legal ecosystem (English ↔ Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati,
Kannada), which reached an advanced stage of development and was recognised for its
approach of translating legal *intent and effect*, not just words. This skill takes that
same philosophy global: every language pair, every jurisdiction, every document type.

The goal is not to produce a finished translation. The goal is to produce a high-quality
**draft** that a bilingual lawyer or qualified legal translator can review, verify, and
finalise for use.

---

## Audience

This skill is designed for use by:
- **Bilingual lawyers** reviewing AI-assisted drafts before client or court use
- **Qualified legal translators** using AI to accelerate first-draft production
- **In-house counsel** working across jurisdictions who need a working draft for review
- **Legal paralegals** preparing documents for supervising lawyer sign-off

**Not for:** end-clients self-serving translations of binding instruments without lawyer review. Every output from this skill is a draft, not a final-form instrument.

---

## Not in Scope

**Stop and redirect** if the request falls into any of these categories:

- **Certified / sworn translations** required for court filing, immigration authorities, or official government submission — route to a credentialed sworn translator in the relevant jurisdiction
- **Apostilled documents** where the translation must itself be re-apostilled — the apostille chain requires a human certified translator
- **Jurisdictions with statutory restrictions** on AI-assisted translation of court filings or legal instruments (check local bar rules before proceeding)
- **Documents where no bilingual reviewer is available** — if the user cannot identify a qualified bilingual reviewer, do not produce a full translation; explain why and suggest they engage a certified translator
- **Requests for legal advice** on the translated content — this skill translates; it does not advise on legal effect in the target jurisdiction

If any of the above applies, say so clearly and stop.

---

## Work Shape

This is **accretive-judgment work** — the output is a draft for a bilingual reviewer, not a final-form instrument. Every output must:

1. Be watermarked: `⚠ DRAFT — Bilingual lawyer or qualified legal translator review required before execution or filing`
2. Include clause-level confidence bands (see Step 3)
3. Include at least one specific clause flagged for lawyer review in Translator's Notes
4. End with the delegation gate (see Step 6)

---

## Escalation Triggers — Halt and Ask

Stop translating and ask the user before proceeding if any of the following apply:

- **Document type cannot be identified** — ask the user to describe it
- **Source or target jurisdiction is unclear** — do not assume; ask
- **Target language not specified** — ask; never assume from context
- **Document contains untranslatable terms with material legal effect** — flag each one, explain the gap, ask how to proceed
- **Request is for a certified/sworn output** — explain this is out of scope; redirect
- **Governing law clause conflicts with party addresses or stated jurisdiction** — flag the conflict; ask which governs
- **Source text is ambiguous in a way that changes legal meaning** — do not resolve arbitrarily; flag and ask

---

## The Four Layers of Legal Translation

Every legal translation must work at all four layers simultaneously:

1. **Linguistic** — correct grammar, syntax, vocabulary in target language
2. **Legal-technical** — correct legal terms of art, not dictionary translations
3. **Jurisdictional** — how this type of document is actually drafted in the target language's legal system
4. **Pragmatic** — does this read like it was drafted natively? Would a lawyer in the target jurisdiction trust this document?

A translation that passes Layer 1 but fails Layer 4 is useless for legal purposes.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1 — Intake and Analysis

Before translating a single word, analyze the document:

**Required inputs — if any are missing, ask before proceeding:**
- Source language *(required)*
- Source jurisdiction *(required — do not proceed with assumed jurisdiction)*
- Target language *(required)*
- Target jurisdiction *(required — do not proceed with assumed jurisdiction)*

**Also identify:**
- Document type (see Document Type Library below)
- Parties and their roles
- All defined terms (these must be translated consistently throughout)
- Special clauses: arbitration, governing law, force majeure, indemnity, liability caps
- Dates, reference numbers, amounts — note all; they must not change

**Read the right reference file:**
- For target language conventions → `references/legal-language-conventions.md`
- For document-type patterns → `references/document-type-library.md`
- For legal terms across languages → `references/legal-glossary.md`

**State your intake findings** briefly before translating, e.g.:
> *"Detected: English lease agreement (Indian jurisdiction) → Hindi (Maharashtra). Parties: Landlord / Tenant. Defined terms: 8. Special clauses: arbitration (Mumbai seat), notice period. No escalation triggers. Proceeding."*

### Step 2 — Pre-Translation Glossary Build

For any document over ~200 words, mentally build a translation glossary first:

1. List all defined terms in the source document
2. Assign their target-language equivalents (consistently)
3. Note any terms with no direct equivalent in the target legal system
4. Note proper nouns, company names, reference numbers — flag these as UNTRANSLATED

For long documents, show this glossary to the user before proceeding:
> *"Before I translate, here are my term mappings: [table]. Does this look right?"*

This is the single most important quality step. Inconsistent term translation is the #1 failure mode in legal translation.

### Step 3 — Translate with Confidence Bands

**The golden rule:** Translate legal *effect*, not legal *words*.

**Assign a confidence band to every clause or section:**

| Band | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🟢 H | Standard term with a well-established direct equivalent in the target legal system. Low reviewer burden. |
| 🟡 M | Term of art with a documented equivalent, but jurisdictional drift is possible. Reviewer should verify. |
| 🔴 L | No direct equivalent in target legal system — explanatory translation only. Lawyer must review and adapt. |

Mark each clause or section with its band in the output: `[H]`, `[M]`, or `[L]`.

Apply these rules without exception:

#### Structure
- Preserve ALL structural elements: clause numbering (1.1, 1.1.1), headings, sub-headings, schedules, annexures, recitals, definitions sections, signature blocks
- Never merge or split clauses
- Never reorder content
- Tables → preserve as tables; column headers translated, data preserved

#### Legal Language Conventions
- Use the traditional formal opening for this document type in the target language (see `references/document-type-library.md`)
- WHEREAS clauses → translate to the traditional recital form in target language
- IN WITNESS WHEREOF → translate to the traditional closing attestation in target language
- Operative words (shall, will, must, may, agrees to) → use their correct legal equivalents, not conversational equivalents
- "Shall" in legal drafting ≠ future tense; it means obligation — translate accordingly

#### Defined Terms
- Once a term is defined (e.g., "the Company"), use only that translated term everywhere
- Never paraphrase a defined term mid-document
- Definitions section → translate the definition label AND the definition body

#### Proper Nouns — STRICT RULE
- Party names (people, companies) → NEVER translate, NEVER transliterate unless specifically requested
- Place names → keep in original, add transliteration in parentheses on first use if target uses a different script
- Reference numbers, case numbers, registration numbers → NEVER change

#### Dates and Numbers — STRICT RULE
- Dates: preserve in original format; optionally add local format in parentheses
- Currency: preserve symbol and amount exactly (₹50,000 stays ₹50,000)
- Percentages, fractions, measurements → never change

#### Operative vs Recital Language
- Recitals (WHEREAS) → descriptive, past/present tense, translate naturally
- Operative provisions (the actual obligations) → precise, use "shall/will/must" equivalents, no ambiguity
- Definitions → match the formality and precision of the source

### Step 4 — Transliteration (when requested or needed)

Transliteration = converting a word's *sounds* into a different script, while translation = converting its *meaning*.

**When to transliterate vs translate:**

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Party name in a different script | Transliterate (e.g., "Rahul Sharma" → "راحل شرما" in Urdu script) |
| Company name | Transliterate, never translate |
| A legal term that exists in the source jurisdiction but not the target | Translate + transliterate original in parentheses |
| Place names | Translate official name if one exists; otherwise transliterate |
| Currency names | Translate (rupee → روپیہ) |
| Legal latin phrases (force majeure, mens rea, etc.) | Keep in Latin; add translated meaning in parentheses |

**Transliteration quality rules:**
- Use the most widely accepted romanization/script convention for the language pair
- For Devanagari ↔ Latin: use IAST standard for formal/academic; simplified phonetic for legal
- For Arabic ↔ Latin: use simplified ALA-LC for legal documents
- For Cyrillic ↔ Latin: use BGN/PCGN romanization
- For Chinese ↔ Latin: use Hanyu Pinyin with tone marks
- For Japanese ↔ Latin: use Modified Hepburn

Always mark transliterations clearly: *[transliteration]* or in italics

### Step 5 — Format and Present Output

**Mandatory output header on every translation:**
```
⚠ DRAFT — Bilingual lawyer or qualified legal translator review required before execution or filing
Skill: legal-translation v0.2.0 | Source: [language/jurisdiction] | Target: [language/jurisdiction]
```

**For inline text (pasted content, short extracts):**
Show the full translated text in a clean block with confidence bands per clause. Follow with Translator's Notes.

**For full documents:**
```
---
⚠ DRAFT — Bilingual lawyer or qualified legal translator review required before execution or filing
---
[DOCUMENT HEADER - translated]
---
[Full translated document body — each clause marked [H], [M], or [L]]
---
TRANSLATOR'S NOTES:
[See Step 6]
---
```

**For file inputs (PDF/DOCX) → file outputs:**
- Read source file using pdf-reading skill or docx skill as appropriate
- Produce translated DOCX using the docx skill
- Preserve formatting: fonts, spacing, heading styles, tables
- For RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Persian): note to user that paragraph direction must be set RTL in Word

**For bilingual documents (side-by-side):**
Present in a two-column table: Original | Translation, clause by clause, with confidence band in a third column.

### Step 6 — Translator's Notes and Delegation Gate

Every output ends with this structure:

```
TRANSLATOR'S NOTES
==================
Confidence summary: [X clauses H] [Y clauses M] [Z clauses L]

Terms with no direct equivalent:
• [term] — [what was chosen and why] [L]

Jurisdictional gaps:
• [any concept that exists in source jurisdiction but not target]

Flagged for mandatory lawyer review:
• Clause [X] — [reason: untranslatable term / jurisdictional gap / operative ambiguity]
• [at least one clause must always be listed here]

Transliteration key:
• [any names or terms that were transliterated]

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DELEGATION GATE

This output is a translation draft, not a final-form legal instrument.

✗ This is NOT legal advice. Interpretation of legal effect in the target 
  jurisdiction is the responsibility of a qualified lawyer in that jurisdiction.

✗ Privilege warning: If this document is privileged or work-product protected,
  sharing it for translation may break privilege unless the translator is within 
  the privilege circle. Confirm with supervising counsel before sharing.

✗ Accountability: The bilingual lawyer or qualified legal translator reviewing 
  this draft is accountable for the final translation — not this skill.

✗ For court filing, official submission, apostilled documents, or certified use:
  engage a sworn/certified translator in the relevant jurisdiction.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Failure Modes

### (i) Legal advice vs. legal support
This skill provides **translation support**, not legal advice. It does not and cannot:
- Advise on whether a translated clause will be enforceable in the target jurisdiction
- Advise on whether the original document's terms are commercially appropriate
- Interpret legal effect in the target jurisdiction's courts

Interpretation of legal effect in the target jurisdiction is the local lawyer's call.

### (ii) Privilege implications
Translating a privileged document or work-product may **break legal professional privilege** if the document is shared outside the privilege circle. Before translating any litigation document, draft legal advice, or privileged communication:
- Confirm the translator is within the privilege circle (e.g., engaged by the same client or instructed by the same lawyer)
- Flag this to the user if the document appears to be privileged material

### (iii) Accountability gap
This skill produces a draft. The bilingual lawyer or qualified legal translator named in the engagement is accountable for the final translation. This skill is not a substitute for professional accountability.

## File Handling

| Input type | Method |
|------------|--------|
| Uploaded PDF | Use pdf-reading skill: `pdftotext -layout` first; rasterize pages if garbled/scanned |
| Uploaded DOCX | Use docx skill: `extract-text document.docx` |
| Pasted text | Translate directly |
| Scanned image/PDF | Rasterize pages with `pdftoppm`, read visually via vision, then translate |

| Output type | Method |
|-------------|--------|
| Chat (default) | Present translated text in clean formatted block with draft watermark |
| DOCX output | Use docx skill to produce formatted Word document; include draft watermark in header |
| Bilingual DOCX | Two-column table + confidence band column in DOCX via docx skill |
| PDF output | Use pdf skill |

## Supported Language Pairs

This skill handles all major language pairs. For language-specific conventions and script guidance, see `references/legal-language-conventions.md`.

**Priority legal languages** (most common in international legal work):
- English ↔ Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch
- English ↔ Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu
- English ↔ Arabic (MSA), Hebrew, Turkish, Persian
- English ↔ Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Korean
- English ↔ Russian, Ukrainian, Polish
- Any ↔ Any (not just English-based)

**Script awareness:**
- RTL scripts (Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Persian, Sindhi) → flag layout direction in output
- Devanagari (Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit) → always native script unless user requests romanization
- CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) → use appropriate character set; never mix Simplified/Traditional Chinese
- Latin-script languages with diacritics (French, German, Spanish, Polish, Vietnamese) → never drop accent marks
