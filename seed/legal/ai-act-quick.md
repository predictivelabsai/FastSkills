# EU AI Act Quick Assessment

Fast triage tool (15-25 minutes) for preliminary AI Act classification and compliance assessment. Produces a preliminary output and flags where a full AI Act assessment and qualified legal counsel are needed before relying on the result. This skill is self-contained: a "full assessment" means a documented, depth classification / role / obligation analysis and legal review — not another tool you need to install.

## Disclaimer (show at session start, do not block)

> **Important:** This is a preliminary AI Act assessment based on Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, designed for rapid triage. It is not legal advice and does not replace a full assessment — validate every "Likely" determination through a full, documented AI Act assessment (depth classification, role analysis, and obligation mapping) and qualified legal counsel before relying on it. Effective dates for high-risk obligations reflect the AI Omnibus 2026 postponement (Annex III: 2 December 2027; Annex I: 2 August 2028).

## Who this is for, and what kind of work this is

**Operator.** This triage can be run by a **non-lawyer — a product owner, compliance manager, or founder scoping AI Act exposure** — as well as by counsel. That is exactly why the output is preliminary by construction: if you are not a lawyer, your job is to **route the resulting card to qualified counsel**, not to treat "Likely Minimal" as an all-clear. No special AI fluency is assumed beyond describing the system in plain language.

**Work shape.** This is **bounded-transactional triage**: a single system run once through a fixed 6-gate sequence to produce a directional classification card — fast, pattern-matched, and deliberately shallow. It is the *opening* move of an accretive workflow, not the conclusion: a plausible high-risk or prohibited branch is meant to escalate into the full, documented assessment and counsel (see *Recommended Next Steps*), never to stop at the card. The speed is bought by narrowing scope, and the skill stays inside that narrow scope.

## Quick Assessment Workflow

### Phase 1: Quick Context (Adaptive 2-Batch Flow)

Gather context through a conversational 2-batch approach. Maximum 2 interaction turns — 1 if the user is detailed, 2 if gaps remain.

#### Batch 1: Essential Questions (always asked)

Present these three questions with a natural, conversational welcome:

> **Let's get started with a quick EU AI Act assessment.**
>
> You can answer in your own words — a short paragraph, bullet points, whatever works. I'll ask follow-up questions only if I need more detail.
>
> **1. What does the AI system do?** (2-3 sentences: what it does, how it works at a high level, what outputs it produces)
>
> **2. Where is the system deployed?** (For reference: EU/EEA market, Switzerland with EU reach, outside EU but outputs used in EU, or no EU connection)
>
> **3. What is your organization's relationship to it?** (For reference: developed in-house, purchased/licensed, modified/finetuned, distribute/import, or evaluating for acquisition)

#### Coverage Analysis (internal — not shown to user)

After the user responds to Batch 1, silently check whether their answer covers each of the 8 required fields. Be generous with extraction — e.g., "German Mittelstand" covers both jurisdiction (DE) and organization size (medium); "CV screening tool" covers sector (HR/employment) and affected persons (employees/job applicants).

| # | Field | Extract from |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | System description | Batch 1 Q1 |
| 2 | Deployment context | Batch 1 Q2 |
| 3 | Organization role | Batch 1 Q3 |
| 4 | Sector | Often inferable from system description |
| 5 | Affected persons | Often inferable from system description + sector |
| 6 | Modifications | Often inferable from organization role |
| 7 | Organization size | Sometimes mentioned in context |
| 8 | Jurisdiction(s) | Often inferable from deployment context |

Mark each field: **Covered** / **Partially covered** / **Not covered**.

#### Batch 2: Adaptive Follow-Up (only if gaps remain)

- **All 8 fields covered** → Skip Batch 2. Briefly confirm your extractions and proceed to Phase 2.
- **Gaps remain** → Send ONE follow-up message covering ONLY the missing or partially covered fields, conversationally framed. Do not re-ask what was already answered.
- **Partially covered fields** → Use confirmation prompts, not full re-asks. Example: "You mentioned healthcare — is this specifically in the medical devices sector?"
- **Unclear fields** → If still unresolvable after Batch 2, mark as `[UNCLEAR — proceeding with cautious assumptions]` and note the assumption made.

Example follow-up (if sector, size, and jurisdiction are missing):
> **Just a few more details to round out the picture:**
>
> - What sector does this fall into? (e.g., healthcare, financial services, HR/employment, education, public administration, other)
> - Roughly how large is your organization? (e.g., under 50 employees, 50-249, or 250+)
> - Which EU/EEA country or countries are involved?

#### Information Normalization (internal — before Phase 2)

Before proceeding to Phase 2, normalize all gathered information into the structured 8-field format so the Phase 2 gate sequence can reference fields consistently:

1. **System description** — free text
2. **Deployment context** — one of: EU/EEA market, Switzerland with EU reach, Outside EU but outputs used in EU, No EU connection
3. **Organization role** — one of: Developed in-house, Purchased/licensed, Modified/finetuned, Distribute/import, Evaluating
4. **Sector** — mapped to: Healthcare/medical devices, Financial services, HR/employment, Education, Law enforcement/justice, Critical infrastructure, Public administration, Consumer/retail, Other
5. **Affected persons** — one or more of: Employees/workers, Customers/consumers, Citizens/public, Students, Patients, Internal only
6. **Modifications** — one of: No modifications, Configuration within intended range, Finetuning/retraining, Changed intended purpose, Own brand applied
7. **Organization size** — one of: Micro (<10), Small (10-49), Medium (50-249), Large (250+)
8. **Jurisdiction(s)** — list of EU/EEA Member States or Switzerland

### Phase 2: Rapid Classification (6-Step Gate Sequence)

Read [references/quick-decision-tree.md](references/quick-decision-tree.md) for the condensed classification logic.

Process the answers through the 6-step gate sequence **internally** (do not ask additional questions unless critical information is missing). Output the result as a single assessment.

**Gate 1: Scope Check (Art. 2)**
- If deployment context is "No EU connection" → likely out of scope → note and proceed cautiously
- Check for military, personal use, pure R&D exclusions based on system description

**Gate 2: AI System Test (Art. 3(1))**
- Quick determination based on system description
- Apply simplified 3-question test: (1) machine-based? (2) infers/generates beyond rules? (3) influences environment?

**Gate 3: Prohibited Practice Screen (Art. 5)**
- Rapid screen based on system description and sector
- Flag any potential Art. 5 concern for detailed review

**Gate 4: High-Risk Assessment (Annex I + III)**
- Map sector + use case to Annex I/III categories
- Use sector answer as primary trigger indicator
- If Annex III triggered: quick Art. 6(3) exception check
- If the high-risk branch is plausible, flag that a **full Art. 6 high-risk assessment** — grounded in the Commission's Art. 6(3) / Annex III guidelines and the classification's documented reasoning — is needed before treating the system as in or out of the high-risk tier.

**Gate 5: GPAI Check**
- Based on system description: does it use a general-purpose AI model?
- If yes: note GPAI obligations

**Gate 6: Transparency Triggers (Art. 50)**
- Check for direct human interaction, synthetic content generation, emotion recognition, deep fakes

### Confidence — three bands, three behaviors

The `Confidence` field in the output is not decorative. Each level changes what you do with the determination, so an ambiguous call never reads the same as a clear one:

- **High** — the gates land cleanly on the facts given → **proceed**: present the card as a confident preliminary, with the normal "validate before compliance decisions" caveat.
- **Medium** — the classification turns on an assumption or a field marked partially covered → **surface and ask**: state the determination, but name the specific assumption it rests on and put the open question to the user rather than smoothing it over.
- **Low** — key facts are missing, the system sits on a risk-tier boundary, or an Art. 5 / Annex III branch is plausible but unconfirmed → **hand back**: lead with the uncertainty, flag the higher risk tier as the working assumption, and make escalation to the full assessment and counsel the headline, not a footnote.

When in doubt between two bands, pick the lower one.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Full classification with documented reasoning — re-run every gate at depth
   (Art. 2 scope, Art. 3(1) AI-system test, Art. 5 prohibited screen, Annex I/III
   high-risk with the Art. 6(3) exception analysis, GPAI, Art. 50), recording the
   legal basis for each determination.
   [Priority: HIGH / MEDIUM — based on preliminary findings]

2. Detailed role determination — confirm provider / deployer / quasi-provider /
   importer / distributor, including any Art. 25 quasi-provider trigger from
   fine-tuning, substantial modification, or own-branding.
   [Priority: HIGH if quasi-provider risk detected / MEDIUM otherwise]

3. Complete obligation mapping with owners (RACI) for the confirmed risk tier and role.
   [Priority: HIGH if high-risk / MEDIUM if limited risk]

4. Formal assessment documentation for the file — classification record
   (Prüfprotokoll), obligation/compliance register, and management briefing
   (Entscheidungsvorlage).
   [Priority: HIGH for regulatory files / MEDIUM for internal tracking]

5. Engage legal counsel for:
   [List specific areas requiring legal judgment]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠ This preliminary assessment provides directional guidance only. Every
  determination marked "Likely" requires validation through a full, documented
  AI Act assessment (steps 1–4 above) and legal review before it is relied on.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Phase 4: Template Offer (Optional)

After presenting the preliminary assessment, offer:

> "Would you like me to generate a preliminary version of any of the following templates? These will be marked as preliminary and should be finalized after a full assessment."
>
> 1. **Classification Record (Prüfprotokoll)** — preliminary audit trail
> 2. **Compliance Register Entry** — preliminary obligation tracker
> 3. **Management Briefing (Entscheidungsvorlage)** — preliminary decision document

If requested, generate the chosen template from the assessment fields above using a standard structure
— **Classification Record:** system, role, risk tier, legal basis per gate, confidence, open
questions; **Compliance Register Entry:** obligation, article, owner, urgency, deadline, status;
**Management Briefing:** one-paragraph summary, risk tier + exposure, decision asked of management,
recommended next steps. Mark every output prominently as "PRELIMINARY — Full assessment recommended."

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **This is a triage tool** — always recommend a full, documented assessment for compliance decisions
2. **"Likely" is not "confirmed"** — preliminary determinations require validation
3. **Err on the side of caution** — if uncertain between risk tiers, flag the higher risk tier as possible
4. **Flag uncertainty explicitly** — the Confidence band drives behavior: High → proceed, Medium → surface the assumption and ask, Low → lead with the uncertainty and hand back (see *Confidence — three bands, three behaviors*)
5. **National requirements matter** — always flag jurisdiction-specific obligations using [references/jurisdiction-flags.md]
6. **Compliance timeline** — reference [references/compliance-deadlines.md] for deadline urgency
7. **Enforcement exposure (Art. 99)** — for penalty context: prohibited practices (Art. 5) up to **€35M or 7%** of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher (Art. 99(3)); most other provider/deployer breaches up to **€15M or 3%** (Art. 99(4)); supplying incorrect/incomplete/misleading information to authorities up to **€7.5M or 1%** (Art. 99(5)); for SMEs and start-ups the **lower** of the fixed amount or the percentage applies (Art. 99(6))

## What this skill does not do

This section is a feature, not a disclaimer reflex — it tells the user when to escalate beyond the skill.

- **It is not legal advice and does not produce a compliance decision.** It is a rapid triage that yields "Likely" determinations only; it does not replace a full, documented AI Act assessment or qualified legal counsel.
- **It does not confirm a risk tier.** Prohibited-practice (Art. 5) and high-risk (Annex I/III + Art. 6(3)) determinations are flagged as *possible* and must be confirmed through depth analysis — a "Likely High-Risk" output is a prompt to investigate, not a classification to rely on.
- **It does not invent legal substance or citations.** Article and Annex references come from the reference files; where the inputs are too thin to support a determination, the skill marks the field `[UNCLEAR]` and proceeds on stated cautious assumptions rather than guessing.
- **It does not certify compliance or quantify actual fines.** Penalty figures are the Art. 99 statutory maxima for context, not a prediction of exposure in a given case.
- **It does not track live enforcement or guideline status.** It prompts a web search on activation because Commission guidelines and national enforcement are still developing; determinations are calibrated to the picture at authoring time.
- **It is self-contained at LegalQuants.** Where it refers to a "full assessment," that means the depth analysis and legal review described in the Recommended Next Steps — not a dependency on any other installed skill.
